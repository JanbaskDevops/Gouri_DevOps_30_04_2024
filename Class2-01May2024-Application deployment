=============================================================================
Application: Application is a peace of code that solve some problem.

Spring pet clinic:
=================
> Here they have clinic for pet and plants for day basis
> They have specialized doctors who take care of pets and plants


Development of spring pet clinic
================================
Development Team develop the application, and provide the deployment steps.

[link] > https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic

Spring Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You can then access the Petclinic at http://localhost:8080/.

Teams
======
1) Server: It's a place where we would be running our application.[we will get with killer koda]

2) Provisioning: When we are installing any software in top of operating system is known provisioning.

2.1)How to check java is installed or not?
ubuntu $ java --version

2.2)Before installing any software we should update our repository
    apt-get update
    apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless

"apt-get update" updates the local package index, fetching the latest package lists from the repositories specified in /etc/apt/sources.list or files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

Do you want to continue? [Y/n]


Command 'java' not found, but can be installed with:

apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless  # version 11.0.20.1+1-0ubuntu1~20.04, or
apt install default-jre              # version 2:1.11-72
apt install openjdk-16-jre-headless  # version 16.0.1+9-1~20.04
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless  # version 17.0.8.1+1~us1-0ubuntu1~20.04
apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless   # version 8u382-ga-1~20.04.1
apt install openjdk-13-jre-headless  # version 13.0.7+5-0ubuntu1~20.04


3) Dependancy: it's like pre work for installing any software

ubuntu $ ./mvnw package
Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.
  We cannot execute 


How I get server?
with the help of killerkoda

Background of unix and Linux and flavor of linux
=================================================
in 1950 > communication was unidirection

Scintist developed UNICS software[written in B and low level programming language] to convert unidirection communication to bi-direction

With the help UNICS they have written a new programming language[rewrite B] they have given the name C programming.

with C they have rewritten UNICS for user purpose known as UNIX

Unix is a base operating system, we need to install application in top of unix to intract with it that is reffered as Linux

Linux= Unix + application

Now, their are multiple IT companies created their own Linux environment

1) ubuntu
2) Fadora
3) Centos
4) IBM-i
5) Redhat

[JIRA]
======
JIRA is a project management ticketing tool, where would be raising ticket against any parties
userstory
EPIC
Bug

Problem with application deployment
===================================
1) Server is temporary, and it can be down at any time.

2) Autoscalling in not possible
       Example: 1 server support 100 user
                now, requirement is 10000 user > 100 similar server

Now, you need a enterprise solution to run your application.

1) Running application in data center.
======================================
Datacenter is a location where you would be having all the resources required for application[Compute, storage, networking and database]

If you want to setup datacenter it required very high cost, alternative is cloud


2) Running application in cloud.
================================
Running your application on someone else data center, and paying rent to them.
