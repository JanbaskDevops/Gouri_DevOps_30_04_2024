Application Engineering
========================

> SDLC
> Design Thinking
> DevOps Introduction

Example: JanBask want to create on learning website where you can manage end to end learning.

SDLC[Software development life cycle]: It's step by step process for designing the software. 
Every software will expire in sometime.

1) Plan    
2) Code     
3) Build      
4) Test
5) Release   
6) Deploy   
7) Operate
8) Monitor

Plan
=====
Requirement gathering+ Analysis[pre-work]+ Resource management

Codding
=======
Here, Developer will write the code according to requirement.

Build
=====
I want to add 2 number in python

x = 50
y = 10
print(x + y)


When developer is writing the code, he writes business logic. but we need to add presentation logic into it, this stage is known as build phase.

Testing
=======
We just want to make sure things are working fine.

These 4 phases are known as development phase.

CMMI> The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process and behavioral model that helps organizations streamline process improvement and encourage productive, efficient behaviors that decrease risks in software, product, and service development.

CMMI is a way to rate organisation

CMMI Level1
CMMI Level2
CMMI Level3
CMMI Level4
CMMI Level5

In Software development we follow CMMI Level5. As per CMMI level5, we should test our product multiple times before delivering to customer,
SO for that purpose we have multiple environment-

1) Dev

2) Test

3) QA

4) Preprod

5) Prod

Release: When I do deployment on any environment expert production.

Deploy: When I do deployment in Production

   >>Deployment<< Adding code to server
          I want to make my E-learning code available over internet

Operate: I need to do maintenance or do some activities.

Monitor: My speed limit is 80KM/H> Speedmeter

Developer mindset
=================

In IT industry Developer are pillar, because they are thinking for the application that they have never seen, and these people are 10 years ahead.

ATM thinking        :1990
ATM withdrawl Money: 2000

Operator mindset
================
They just follow the instruction.[security guard]. Process oriented people


Design thinking
===============
Before giving solution, understand the problem, and figureoout multiple solutions, and opt for the best.


I want you to plan your travel from US to India
1) you will think for Money part
2) you need to plan number of days
3) Process
2) return journey
